### What is TriEngine?
*"The prefix "tri-" means "three". It comes from both Greek and Latin words meaning "three". "Tri-" is often used with nouns and adjectives to indicate that something has three parts or elements."*

**TriEngine is a solo 3D game engine started as a hobby to learn how 3D engines work and how to develop them.**

TriEngine is currently using:
* OpenGL
* Glad
* Win32 (for window management and creation)
* glm (for transformations and other mathy stuff)
* stb (for image loading)

## Why won't TriEngine be cross-platform?
From my stand-point I believe that cross-platform is not very necessary in my case, I do not plan to develop for Mac since ***they deprecated OpenGL in favor of Metal, and I do not want to deal with 2 graphics apis***
and since I develop in and use Windows mainly and feel like a large majority use Windows for gaming and developing games, I believe that cross-platform support is something I feel like I do not want to touch apon for TriEngine.

*Sorry!*

## What does TriEngine offer?
As of right now, not much. It is still being ***frequently developed*** by me. I hope to achieve what most other modern engine have.

## What does TriEngine plan to have?
* Tooling (IE: Game Engine Editor)
* C++ / Lua Integration (Lua is a very powerful language, and also very popular in other games like <a href="https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Beginner_Tutorial_Intro">Garry's Mod</a>)
* ^ Tooling plans to allow developers to make their own C++ and Lua scripts and allow modders to make Lua files, which gives developers more control over their game and modding.
